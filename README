Hello,

Thank you for considering me.

Few things to note:
* I developed this application using BDD/TDD with Ruby 1.8.7
* I used metaprogramming when creating the Product class to avoid persisting data with ActiveRecord
* I implemented the 3 test cases requested in cucumber
* I developed 9 tests for the Product and SaleTerminal classes with rspec

Steps to running the tests:
* Clone this git repo
* Run "bundle install" which will install cucumber and rspec
* Run the cucumber steps using "bundle exec cucumber features"
* Run the specs using "bundle exec rspec spec"

Thank you,
Sarkis Karayan
